            This is my project for the web module in Softuni.

            It is made using React.js for Frontend and the Softuni practise server for backend.


            1.It is themed after a medieval fantasy of a tavern full of heroes
            (and sometimes villains) who like to drink(alot)
            
            and go on journeys and quests for glory and adventure!

        </section>
