                The hero's tavern is 
                a tavern far off into the mountains , where
                adventurers of all sorts gather to have a drink , have a laugh
                , sometimes get in a fight, and perhaps earn some gold from bounties...?
                All are welcome in the Hero's Tavern , so hop on in
                and have a good time why don't you?
